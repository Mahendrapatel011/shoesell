## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (You can use a local instance or a free cloud instance from MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend (`/scatch`):**

    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```bash
        cd scatch
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `/scatch` directory. This file will store your environment variables.
        ```
        PORT=3001
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
        CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    The server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:3001`.

3.  **Set up the Frontend (`/scatch-frontend`):**

    *   Open a **new terminal window** and navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd scatch-frontend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Start the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    The React application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

### üéâ You're All Set!

The application should now be fully functional on your local machine. The frontend will make requests to your local backend server.

Happy coding!
